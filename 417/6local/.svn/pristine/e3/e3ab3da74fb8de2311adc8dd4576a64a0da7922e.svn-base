		Test  1 failed (id3tree on xor data) due to a MATLAB error: Output argument "T" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "id3tree".
		Test  2 failed (id3tree with maxdepth) due to a MATLAB error: Output argument "T" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "id3tree".
		Test  3 failed (evaltree) due to a MATLAB error: Undefined function or variable "Txid3t1".
		Test  4 failed (forest) due to a MATLAB error: Output argument "F" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "forest".
		Test  5 failed (prunetree) due to a MATLAB error: Output argument "T" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "id3tree".
		Test  6 failed (boosttree and evalboost) due to a MATLAB error: Output argument "BDT" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "boosttree".
		Test  7 failed (quality and efficiency (4 tests)) due to a MATLAB error: Output argument "T" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "id3tree".
